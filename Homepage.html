			<h4>So... why buy our products?</h4>
			
			<p class "dis">Do you play a musical Instrument? And don't you hate it when you are playing a longer
			peice and then in the middle of an intense section you have to stop playing to turn the 
			page, causing the sound quality to diminish? Well then look no further becasue our music stand clip-ons have got you covered!</p>
			
			<br>	
			<p>Our simple design complements the stand perfectly, meaning that you can just add it on to your
			existing music stand. Operated with a convinent foot pedal, It will turn the pages quickly and automatically without you having to 
			stop playing. And for all you players who cannot press the pedal, we are looking into a recognition system
			that will recognise what song you are playing (<i>regardless of your instrument!</i>) and know when to turn for you. However, this system is still in planning.</p>

			<h2>Music Stands</h2>
			<h4>Simple</h4>
			<p>The simple stand is operated by a foot pedal. This is perfect for a violin player or even anyone in an Orcestra <i>who can't stand to turn the pages.</i></p>
